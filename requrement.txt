1.# Using flask to make an api

I create simple api on a server it can be provide the return masseges in a server.





2.I am making a data visualization tool that takes input from the user (choosing a file on the computer); 
processes it in Python with Pandas, Numpy, etc; 
and displays the data in the browser on a local server.

Step1-Create a One New folder Name is Template (Template is use for the  render the Html page in Flask)

Step2-Write the text file functionality inside the app.py file.

Note:- I am not able to accept the text file in a server.
    Because of we are not create the databases.


3.Render the Html Template


4.Sessions

In addition to the request object there is also a second object called session.
which allows you to store information specific to a user from one request to the next. 
This is implemented on top of cookies for you and signs the cookies cryptographically. 
What this means is that the user could look at the contents of your cookie but not modify it, 
unless they know the secret key used for signing.
